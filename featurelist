nubernel-2.6.35_v0.0.2

Includes a custom "Nubernel the kernel" bootlogo.
Includes kexec support.
Ensures su is installed properly. (tw build only!)
Ensures superuser is installed properly. (tw build only!)
Ensures busybox is installed properly. (tw build only!)
Installs bash into /system/bin/ (if it is not found). (tw build only!)
Installs bash resources if they do not already exist. (tw build only!)
Includes flash tools (redbend_ua and bmlwrite) in /sbin. (tw build only!)
Includes custom scripts in /vendor/bin. (tw build only!)
Recovery redirector, "reboot recovery" will boot to the recovery kernel (bml8).
Supports the following:
  init.d scripts, init.local.rc, RFS, EXT4, CIFS, TUN, Netfilter TCPMSS (init.d scripts = tw build only).
Fully supports VoltageControl and SetCPU (see SetCPU notes below).
SetCPU notes:
  SetCPU aparently uses "cpuinfo_cur_freq" rather than "scaling_cur_freq" for it's live readout.
  For some reason, "cpuinfo_cur_freq" reports being at some strange frequencies (75MHz, 150MHz, 300MHz).
  I have no idea why this is happening, or how to fix it as of now, sorry.
Includes the following I/O schedulers:
  noop, deadline, cfq, bfq, sio.
Uses deadline as the default I/O scheduler.
Includes the following CPU frequencies:
  100MHz, 200MHz, 400MHz, 600MHz, 800MHz, 900MHz, 1000MHz, 1100MHz, 1200MHz, 1300MHz, 1400MHz.
The following CPU frequencies are disabled by default (use an app to enable them):
  1200MHz, 1300MHz, 1400MHz.
Includes the following CPU governors (see notes below):
  smartassV2, smartass, interactiveX, interactive, conservative, userspace, powersave, ondemand, performance.
Uses ondemand as the default CPU governor.
CPU governor notes:
  There seems to be a scaling problem with smartass (not V2).
  It likes to hang out at 900MHz, I'll try to fix it later.
Loads the Android logger as a module. (tw build only!)
Supports the following types of bootanimations (See notes):
  bootanimation (bootanimation.zip).
  samsungani (*.qmg). (tw build only!)
Bootanimation notes:
  bootanimation.zip:
    If you have both bootanimation.zip and boot*.qmg files, they will fight each other.
    It's better than froyo was, in that, it will kind of randomly choose one or the other.
    It's best to just remove the boot*.qmg files if using a bootanimation.zip animation.
  Samsung boot*.qmg boot animations:
    You must still fake out the kernel with a "blank" bootanimation.zip.
    You still might see a small glimpse of the framework's animation (blue android logo).
Includes system app mover and remover: (tw build only!)
  During boot, the init scripts make room to install root and recovery. (tw build only!)
  Apps that are moved will have their data removed (to prevent FC's).
  Two list files are checked to determine what will be moved or removed:
    /data/local/.mv_sys_apps
    /data/local/.rm_sys_apps
  The format of the list files is as follows:
    Each line must contain two strings separated by a space:
      #1 - The system app's apk file name with no extension.
      #2 - The system app's packagename.
    Example:
      FreeHDGameDemos com.gameloft.microwidget
  If the list files do not exist, defaults will be created.
  Apps that will be moved from /system/app to /data/app by default:
    Asphalt5_DEMO_SAMSUNG_D700_Sprint_ML_330 (Asphalt 5 Demo)
    FreeHDGameDemos (Promo Widget)
    nascar09-prod-release (Sprint Nascar)
    qik-8.66-release-ffc (Qik video)
    sfl-prod-release (Sprint NFL)
    SprintTV
    SprintTVWidget
    SprintZone
    TN6.2-sprint-handset-6201501 (Telenav Navigation)
  Apps that will be removed by default:
    Term1
    Term2
    Term3
    Term4
    Term5
