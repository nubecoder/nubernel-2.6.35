Supports the following types of bootanimations (See notes):
  bootanimation (bootanimation.zip).
  samsungani (*.qmg).
Bootanimation notes:
  bootanimation.zip:
    If you have both bootanimation.zip and boot*.qmg files, they will fight each other.
    It's better than froyo was, in that, it will kind of randomly choose one or the other.
    It's best to just remove the boot*.qmg files if using a bootanimation.zip animation.
  Samsung boot*.qmg boot animations:
    You must still fake out the kernel with a "blank" bootanimation.zip.
    You still might see a small glimpse of the framework's animation (blue android logo).
Includes system app mover and remover:
  During boot, the init scripts make room to install root and recovery.
  Apps that are moved will have their data removed (to prevent FC's).
  Two list files are checked to determine what will be moved or removed:
    /data/local/.mv_sys_apps
    /data/local/.rm_sys_apps
  The format of the list files is as follows:
    Each line must contain two strings separated by a space:
      #1 - The system app's apk file name with no extension.
      #2 - The system app's packagename.
    Example:
      FreeHDGameDemos com.gameloft.microwidget
  If the list files do not exist, defaults will be created.
  Apps that will be moved from /system/app to /data/app by default:
    Asphalt5_DEMO_SAMSUNG_D700_Sprint_ML_330 (Asphalt 5 Demo)
    FreeHDGameDemos (Promo Widget)
